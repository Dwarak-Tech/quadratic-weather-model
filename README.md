# Quadratic Weather Model 🌦️

This project simulates weather modeling using a quadratic equation. It walks through different stages of input handling and demonstrates version control using GitHub.

## 📌 Objective

To implement a simple weather model using the quadratic formula, evolving the code in multiple stages:
1. Hard-coded values
2. Keyboard input
3. Input from a file
4. Handling single and multiple datasets

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 🧪 Lab Steps

### Stage 1: Hard-Coded Variables
Solve the quadratic equation with values directly defined in the code.

### Stage 2: Keyboard Input
Accept `a`, `b`, and `c` values from the user at runtime via keyboard.

### Stage 3: File Input
Read coefficients from a `.txt` or `.csv` file to calculate roots.

### Stage 4: Multiple Datasets
Process and solve equations for multiple sets of input from a file.

## 🛠️ Debugging and Fixes
Each version is tested for accuracy and bugs are fixed iteratively.

## 🌐 Version Control with GitHub
- Multiple code versions are saved as separate commits or branches.
- Project hosted and managed using GitHub.

## 🔗 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run any version of the code from the `stages/` folder
3. Use `git` to explore commit history and stages of development

## ✅ Status
✅ Experiment completed and submitted  
✅ All versions stored with commit messages  
✅ GitHub repository initialized and managed
